This is a project of CodeCademy.

Put a lot of effort in this exercice in order to execute it correctly. Really proud of it, hence I wanted to share it on github!

This program checks if a credit card number is valid using the Luhn algorithm. 

Furthermore, it also shares which credit card companies issued these faulty numbers.
